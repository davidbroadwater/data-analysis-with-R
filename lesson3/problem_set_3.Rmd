This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) #must load the ggplot package first 
data(diamonds) #loads the diamonds data set since it comes with the ggplot package 

summary(diamonds)
?diamonds
```


Create a histogram of the price of
all the diamonds in the diamond data set.


```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000), breaks = seq(0, 5000, 500))

length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price < 500))

length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price < 250))

length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price >= 15000))

```

There are no diamonds that cost $1500.

For diamonds that cost less than $2,000, the most common price of a diamond is around $700 with the mode being $605 (binwidth = 1). The second insight comes from Paula F. Thanks Paula!

Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut, scales="free_y")

```

```{r}
table(diamonds$price)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, summary, digits = max(getOption('digits')))

```

# Create a histogram of price per carat
# and facet it by cut. You can make adjustments
# to the code from the previous exercise to get
# started.

# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale
# of the x-axis using log10.

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

```{r}
qplot(x = price/carat, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut, scales="free_y")

```
# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

# There wonâ€™t be a solution video for this
# exercise so go to the discussion thread for either
# BOXPLOTS BY CLARITY, BOXPLOT BY COLOR, or BOXPLOTS BY CUT
# to share you thoughts and to
# see what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
# =================================================================

For boxplots, we use y parameter for the continuous data and the x parameter for the categorical data.

```{r}
qplot(x = cut, y = price, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 7000))

qplot(x = cut, y = price/carat, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 6000))

qplot(x = clarity, y = price, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 7000))

qplot(x = clarity, y = price/carat, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 7000))

qplot(x = clarity, y = carat, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1.75))

qplot(x = color, y = price, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 8000))

qplot(x = color, y = price/carat, 
      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 8000))

?diamonds

by(diamonds$price, diamonds$color, summary, digits = max(getOption('digits')))

IQR(subset(diamonds, color == 'D')$price)

IQR(subset(diamonds, color == 'J')$price)
```


# Investigate the price per carat of diamonds across
# the different colors of diamonds using boxplots.

# SUBMIT YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ===================================================================

```{r}

      data = diamonds, 
      geom = 'boxplot') +

```



```{r}
qplot(x = carat, 
      data = diamonds,
      xlab = "Friend Count",
      ylab = "Proportion of users with that friend count",

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to download a data set of your choice
# and create 2-5 plots that make use of the techniques from Lesson 3.

# You might use a simple histogram, a boxplot split over a categorical variable,
# or a frequency polygon. The choice is yours!

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
# ====================================================================================

The following command may be helpful for some of the Gapminder Data sets, once it's been converted to csv format: read.csv('data.csv', header = T, row.names = 1, check.names = F). You may want to look at additional function arguments in the help file for the read.table() family for additional tools that can help you read in data.

If you want to exchange the rows and columns of your dataframe, it will also be useful to know the transpose function, t().

```{r}
install.packages('tidyr', dependencies = TRUE)
library(tidyr)

cell_data <- read.csv('cell_phone_per_100.csv', header = T, row.names = NULL , check.names = F)


us_data <- subset(cell_data_t, Country == 'United_States')

summary(cell_data$'2011')

cell_data_t <- as.data.frame(t(cell_data[,-1]))
colnames(cell_data_t) <- n
cell_data_t$myfactor <- factor(row.names(cell_data_t))
cell_data_t1 <- gather(cell_data_t, 'Country', 'cell_phones', 2:ncol(cell_data_t))
summary(cell_data_t$'United_States')

cell_data_t$'United_States'
summary(us_data)

us_data = subset(us_data, !is.na(us_data))

qplot(x = cell_data$'2011', y = cell_data$'2011', data = cell_data, geom = 'boxplot')
qplot(x = cell_data$'2010', data = cell_data)
qplot(x = cell_data$'2009', data = cell_data)

# first remember the names
n <- cell_data$Country

# transpose all but the first column (name)

colnames(cell_data_t) <- n
cell_data_t$myfactor <- factor(row.names(cell_data_t))

str(cell_data_t) # Check the column types
```


Facebook Birthdays
```{r}
install.packages('lubridate', dependencies = TRUE)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
birthdays <- read.csv('birthdays.csv', header = T, row.names = NULL , check.names = F)
birthdays$birthday <- as.Date(birthdays$birthday,
  format = "%m/%d/%y")

birthday_dates <- birthdays %>% 
  separate(birthday, c("Year", "Month", "Day"), sep = '-') %>%
  select(-Year)


qplot(x=birthday, 
      data=birthdays,
      xlab="Date",
      ylab="Count of birthdays",
      binwidth=1)

qplot(x=Month, 
      data=birthday_dates,
      xlab="Birth Month",
      ylab="Count of birthdays",
      binwidth=1)

qplot(x=Month, 
      data=birthday_dates,
      xlab="Birth Month",
      ylab="Count of birthdays",
      binwidth=1)

qplot(x=Day, 
      data=birthday_dates,
      xlab="Day of Month",
      ylab="Count of birthdays",
      binwidth=1)

count(birthday_dates,Month)

a=count(birthdays, birthday)
a[order(a$n,a$birthday,decreasing=T),]
```
